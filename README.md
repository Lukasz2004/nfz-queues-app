<h1>NFZ* Queues App </h1>
An application that allows users to retrieve data on medical facilities registered in Poland’s National Health Fund (NFZ) for a selected area, along with the nearest available appointment dates for your selected medical service. The App utilizes the public NFZ’s "Terminy Świadczeń" API.
<br> <br>
The project was developed as part of the "Programming Languages" laboratory classes at Wrocław University of Science and Technology (Politechnika Wrocławska), winter semester 2024/2025.
